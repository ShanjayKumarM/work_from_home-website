          <p>Many people are working from home for the first time because of COVID-19. Others are more seasoned remote workers. Whatever your circumstances, working from home is likely playing a larger part in your life, or that of people you live with, than it ever has before.

At its best, working from home benefits everyone: you, your family or household, and your organization. Remain connected and positive, and you can work productively while maintaining a fulfilling home life – all without the stress of a daily commute.</p>

          <p>As Sarah Harvey says in her book "The Ultimate A-Z of Home Working," "Organizations that don't offer home working may be missing out on a large pool of talent, many of whom now value home working more than they value a bonus."

However, there are challenges. Managers may be concerned whether home workers are in fact working. Meanwhile, many remote employees can feel isolated. They withdraw from the team dynamic, and suffer from stress and anxiety. That's why it is vital to maintain contact with your co-workers, and to cultivate a sense of belonging..</p>

          <p>Working Safely at Home

At home, you're responsible for creating your own working environment, often in a space quite unlike an office. You also need to make sure that you stay mentally and physically healthy..</p>

          <p>Designing Your Work Space

Creating an effective work space is essential if you want to stay on track and get things done. Have all the equipment you need to hand, and ensure that you've got enough room to work comfortably.

Make it a place where you'll enjoy spending time. However, you also need to be clear – to yourself and to your household – that, at certain hours of the day, it's a place of work. A few "office" touches might encourage you to be more productive, but you can still personalize your workspace, with fun posters or family photos.

A high-quality office chair is one of the best investments you can make. But if it's not one that you have the space or funds for, be sure that you can sit comfortably. If not, you'll likely find plenty of excuses to get up and go somewhere else!</p>

          <p>If you share your home, be assertive and shut out people and pets as far as you can when you're working. At the very least, arrange your work area so that distractions aren't in your line of view – including your partner, if they're also working from home!

Pick your spot with light, air and noise in mind, too. Have enough light to see your keyboard clearly, but avoid reflected screen glare. Open a window if you can for fresh air. However, if your neighborhood is noisy, consider using headphones, while accessing online noise-canceling sites, such as mynoise.net..</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Working Securely at Home</h2>

          <p>You're likely accessing your organization's data and systems remotely, so be secure. Take all the protective measures you would when working in the office, and more.

Use only secure WiFi networks that require a password for access. Maintain strong password protocols and ensure that you're using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Your organization will likely insist on this anyway, but if not, ask them about it. It greatly improves cybersecurity.</p>

          <p>When you back up your data, don't save sensitive material to removable media, such as USB sticks or flash drives. These can transfer malware and viruses, and you can also lose them easily.

Lock your computer when it's unattended, even if you're only going to be away from it for a few minutes. Your partner and family likely aren't security risks, but they shouldn't be allowed to see confidential data, while random keystrokes by your children or pets can cause havoc!.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">You likely have a To-Do List for home responsibilities, too. Remember to plan these in as well to create the best work-life balance you can..</blockquote>

          <p>Building in Structure

Agree a clear set of goals with your manager. Along with short-term, task-related targets, make sure that you're also clear about the wider career goals

that you're striving to achieve. Keeping them in mind will motivate you to do your best work, whatever your location.

Make a To-Do List
to manage your workload. This builds structure into your day. But keep the items on it realistic, and broken down into sub-tasks, so that you get a clear sense of progress as you work through it. This will help you to avoid procrastinating, or losing focus by trying to multitask.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Motivation When Working From Home</h2>

          <p>Without people around you it can be difficult to feel motivated and valued. There's no scope for high fives or impromptu shout-outs for a job well done. In these circumstances, using self-motivation techniques

can boost your confidence, promote positive thinking, and keep you powering on.

Don't be invisible! Instead, be bold in offering ideas and suggestions in virtual meetings or in discussions with your manager about working from home. But remember to ask for help when you need it, too. Your manager will be less able to see if you're struggling, so let them know earlier rather than later..</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Key Points.</span>

          <p>Since the onset of COVID-19, more people than ever are working from home. This brings both challenges and opportunities, and requires a shift in a whole range of working practices.

Establish a physical working environment that's secure and comfortable, with minimal distractions. Give your day a structure and a routine that allows for breaks, and plenty of fresh air and exercise..</p>

          <p>Maintain your productivity by focusing on your goals, organizing your tasks, and tackling procrastination. But don't forget to give yourself some downtime when you need it. Also, build in time for your friends and family. You have responsibilities to them, too.

Celebrate team and personal successes, and keep a record of the tasks you complete, so that you can see how productive you're being</p>
